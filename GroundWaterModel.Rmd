##Part 1: Making a regression for the outflow

outflow_reg = lm(outflow~year, data=gw_mgmt)

outflow_reg$fitted #this will show me the regression lines values for the points I put in. Unhelpful in this case 

#now I'm going to use my model 

outflow_reg$coefficients # shows my y intercept and slope

#This uses the model automatically
coef(outflow_reg)[1] #this is the intercept
coef(outflow_reg)[2] #this is the slope

coef(outflow_reg)[1]+coef(outflow_reg)[2]*2002 #example using 2002

#apparently there is a neater way
predict(outflow_reg,list(year=2002)) # for a single value
outflow_mod = predict(outflow_reg,data.frame(year=c(2000:2050))) #this generates a new data frame using the years between 2000 and 2050.

#View(outflow_mod)

##Part 2. Making an Inflow Model 

inflow_reg = lm(inflow~year, data=gw_mgmt)

inflow_reg$fitted #this will show me the regression lines values for the points I put in. Unhelpful in this case 

#now I'm going to use my model 
inflow_reg$coefficients # shows my y intercept and slope

#This uses the model automatically
coef(inflow_reg)[1] #this is the intercept
coef(inflow_reg)[2] #this is the slope

coef(inflow_reg)[1]+coef(inflow_reg)[2]*2002 #example using 2002

#apparently there is a neater way
predict(inflow_reg,list(year=2002)) # for a single value
inflow_mod = predict(inflow_reg,data.frame(year=c(2000:2050))) #this is getting exciting
#View(inflow_mod)
```
